An introductory task showing the role of gauge potential, which yields important non-adiabatic corrections to the dynamics. By engineering the time-dependent Hamiltonian appropriately, it guides the quantum system through its evolution, ensuring that the system remains in its ground state or the desired state. This effectively eliminates errors that could result from non-adiabatic transitions.
